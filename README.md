# BiasedLighting

## The Concept
The project is a system that changes the light intensity and colour of a screen’s bias lighting in response to the content it is displaying. It is also capable of accommodating to the user’s requirements through manual configuration, which is able to be done with both a GUI and directly editing a settings file (allowing it to be transferred to other systems).

There are two main goals for this project; to increase immersion in visual digital media, and to reduce eye strain when viewing a screen in a dim environment.

## Why is this a good idea?
Eye strain is prevalent in people who look at screens in a dim setting for extended periods of time. The sharp difference in brightness between the panel and its border/surroundings plays a large role in causing this problem. 

The dark surroundings cause the pupils to dilate and increase the exposure of light to the retina at the rear of the inner eye, which is meant to allow improved sight in the dark. The issue with this happening in the presence of a screen is that a lot more light is allowed to make contact with the retina than the eye would typically expect.

The results of this digital eye strain phenomenon can include; eye strain or fatigue, blurry vision, difficulty refocusing between near and far distances, tired eyes, double vision, dry eyes, headaches, light sensitivity, and neck or shoulder discomfort. Although these effects are temporary, it is still unhealthy to be subjected to these symptoms.

The problem of excess pupil dilation can be mitigated by creating a larger area of light around the screen. One way to achieve this is with bias lighting. The synchronisation of light intensity with the screen’s content furthers the effectiveness of this method by preventing the reverse effect; the screen being the dimmer area and the surroundings being the brighter area.

## Why should this be done by a computer?
The problem caused by the use of static ambient lighting is a break in immersion; it detracts from whatever is on the screen. The project also aims to eliminate distractions from the use of a screen, whether it be to consume visual digital media or to play video games, by making the bias lighting act as an extension of the content rather than something ‘other’.

This is achieved by taking the average colour values of pixels in various zones along the boundary of the display. The zones are mapped to sets of LED lights directly behind that area on the rear of the screen.

By adding smoothness in the colour and lightness gradients around the display, the area of the content utilises more of the user’s field of vision. This technique makes the display seem less like a frame and thus the experience becomes more immersive.
